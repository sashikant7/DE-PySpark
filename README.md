**Project Overview**

This project involves using Apache Spark to load, transform, and analyze data from a CSV file. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency with Spark SQL and DataFrame operations through a series of tasks that manipulate and query the data. This project highlights the capabilities of Spark for large-scale data processing and the use of SQL for data manipulation and analysis.

**Key Tasks:**

1. **Generate DataFrame from CSV Data**: Load data from a CSV file into a Spark DataFrame for efficient processing.

2. **Define a Schema for the Data**: Explicitly define the schema to ensure correct data types and optimize processing.

3. **Display Schema of DataFrame**: Verify the DataFrame schema to confirm data types and structure.

4. **Create a Temporary View**: Convert the DataFrame into a temporary view to enable SQL-style querying.

5. **Execute an SQL Query**: Perform an SQL query on the temporary view to extract relevant data.

6. **Calculate Average Salary by Department**: Use SQL aggregation functions to compute the average salary for each department.

7. **Filter and Display IT Department Employees**: Apply a filter to show only employees from the IT department.

8. **Add 10% Bonus to Salaries**: Use a DataFrame transformation to calculate and add a 10% bonus to each employee's salary.

9. **Find Maximum Salary by Age**: Identify the highest salary for each age group using aggregation functions.

10. **Self-Join on Employee Data**: Perform a self-join on the DataFrame to analyze relationships within the same dataset.

11. **Calculate Average Employee Age**: Use aggregation to find the average age of all employees.

12. **Calculate Total Salary by Department**: Sum the salaries in each department to get the total expenditure per department.

13. **Sort Data by Age and Salary**: Sort the DataFrame by age in ascending order and salary in descending order for ranked analysis.

14. **Count Employees in Each Department**: Determine the number of employees in each department using a simple count operation.

15. **Filter Employees with the Letter 'o' in the Name**: Extract employees whose names contain the letter 'o', showcasing the use of string functions in filters.
